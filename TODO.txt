Notes from the chat on GL/call reports (plus TODO's):

generate example call report PDF from template
 - fake values just to proof out PDF generation

store GL codes, submit transactions
 - Codes: https://ofm.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/legacy/policy/75.40.htm
 - account id: (example: 0111) as sqlite id: "$ABA-0111" ($ABA is FI routing number)
 - GL codes are the suffix (example: RCON2365 -> 2365)
   - Always numeric? Always N=4 characters long?

take Bob's examples and impl paygate -> sqlite interaction
 - we won't expose sqlite to the public
 - reports are off another API service we write
 - "GL rules" are applied to debit/credit each GL account
   - How custom does this get for each FI?

Call Report Search: https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/ManageFacsimiles.aspx (try Wells or Chase)

Could we sell something off parsing Call Reports? Graphs?
